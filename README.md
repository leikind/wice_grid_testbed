# Testbed for WiceGrid

The aim of this repository is to test the integration of the
[wice_grid](https://github.com/leikind/wice_grid) gem in the different version
of the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

# How to use the repository

## Git

```
$ git clone git://github.com/leikind/wice_grid_testbed.git
$ cd wice_grid_testbed
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

## Rails

### Rails 2

WARNING: The Rails 2 branch is no more maintained. You can use it but keep in
mind that the branch is outdated.

```
$ git checkout rails2
```

### Rails 4

The `master` branch contains the Rails 4 integration so you're already on the
right branch.

## Bundle & WiceGrid

```
$ bundle
$ bundle exec 'rake db:create'
$ bundle exec 'rake db:migrate'
$ bundle exec 'rake db:seed'
$ rails g wice_grid:install
```

## Run the application

In case you want to run the application on your machine, run the following
command:

```
$ rails s
```

Then open the URL http://localhost:3000/ in your favorite web browser.

## Run the tests

### Selenium

Be sure to have Firefox installed first, then run the following command :

```
$ bundle exec rake BROWSER=true
```

A Firefox instance will be fired and the tests are going to be executed in it.

### CI or without UI

In order to run the tests on our CI, we're using the headless driver
[poltergeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist) with
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org).

To run the tests without the UI :

```
$ bundle exec rake
```

### Docker

In case you'd like to test things you could use Docker for that.

The repository is using Docker and Docker-compose in order to containerize and
orchestrate the containers.

This approach allows you to use different versions of things like the database.

After having installed Docker and Docker compose, you just need to run the
following commands in order to get the tests running :

```
$ cd to/the/project/folder
$ docker-compose build
```

This will build the container that will be used afterward in order to run the
app or the tests.

Now the Docker image is created, you can run the application with :

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

(the `-d` flag stands for deamonize)

Now open the URL http://localhost:3000/ and you should have the testbed web app.

In order to run the test, execute the following command :

```
$ docker-compose run web rake
```
