    Filters can also be detached from the grid table. This is a 3-step process.

  %ol
    %li
      First, define the grid with helper
      %code define_grid
      instead of
      %code grid
      \. Everything should be done the same way as with
      %code grid, but every column which will have an external filter, add
      %code detach_with_id: :some_filter_name
      in the
      %code column
      definition.

    %li
      Then use
      %code grid_filter(grid, :some_filter_name)
      to render filters.

    %li
      Finally, use
      %code render_grid(@grid)
      to actually output the grid table
      \.
