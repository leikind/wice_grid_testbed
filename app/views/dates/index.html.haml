    For both
    %code DATE
    and
    %code DATETIME
    fields the filter uses
    %a{:href=>'http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/'}jQuery Datepicker
    by default. It is also possible to use standard Rails Date/Datetime form helpers by specifying
    %code :helper_style => :standard
    in the column definition.
    This might be useful for DATETIME fields as jQuery Datepicker does not support time.
